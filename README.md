Sentiment Classification Using Logistic Regression

Here I have implemented naive bayes baseline classifier. Additionally, I am using pytorch to implement a binary logistic regression classifier. Here the main task is sentiment classification for hotel reviews. The input to this model will be a text review, and the output label is a 1 or 0 marking it as positive or negative.

The util.py file provided will load the data and some of the basic modeling. We will install some dependencies required from the provided requirements.txt file.
